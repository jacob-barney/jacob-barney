        <div class="project-description" id="wage-calc-description"><em>Wage Calculator</em> is a simple hourly wage calculator. This application can accept an hourly wage with the number of hours worked per week and then output how much money you made on a weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or yearly basis. It automatically calculates all hours over 40 per week as 1.5x the base hourly rate entered.</div>
        <div class="project-description" id="guess-number-description"><em>Guess the Number</em> is a simple game. The application randomly generates a number between 1 and 100 and the user tries to guess the number in as few tries as possible. Upon a wrong guess, the application will let you know if you are too high or too low. Give it a try!</div>
        <div class="project-description" id="bulk-pick-description"><em>Bulk Pick Helper</em> is an application I wrote to help with a problem at my former employer, Eaton Corporation. Part of my job at Eaton was to ship large quantities of hoses, sometimes up to 10,000 feet. However, the hoses that we had in stock did not come in standard lengths so you could have any number hose lengths and you had to try to add what you had on hand and get as close to the number that you needed for your shipment as you could. This application will take any combination of lengths and then output the correct hoses to use to arrive at your shipment quantity. Note: a useful combination will only be returned if it comes within 3 feet of the shipment quantity specified.</div>
        <div class="project-description" id="btc-description"><em>Barney's Trading Cards</em> is a mock website designed around a barn motif. Ever since I was a young child, I have always enjoyed collecting sports cards. My son and I have recently gotten into Pokemon cards so I thought it was fitting to try to design something around the hobby.</div>
        <div class="project-description" id="pixel-paint-description">Paint with pixels! The kids really like this one. Try it on a tablet!</div>
        <div class="project-description" id="quick-g-drill-description">Dynamically render a basic 3d model of a g-drill with user inputs. This application uses the p5 library. </div>
        <div class="project-description" id="math-practice-description">Practice your addition, subtraction, and multiplication. For ages 5 - 8.</div>
